 The game board is represented by a list with 9 elements, each element representing a position on the board. The print_board() function is used to display the current state of the game board. The check_win(player) function checks if a player has won the game by checking the rows, columns, and diagonals. The play_game() function allows players to take turns and updates the game board accordingly. The game continues until a player wins or it's a tie.
